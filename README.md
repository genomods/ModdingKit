# ***Everything you need to get started as a modder.***
## *Note: I will update this with time according to my youtube tutorial, link on my profile*

***To start off, download mt-manager-2-14-1.apk from the repository***

***Using MT Manager, create a folder, anywhere you would like, named "Mod Menu"***

**If you have 64Bit phone, go ahead and download ndk_arm64.tar.gz from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YIkj4ggqH2CwjkdqXZspNX4UsdrKUDkd/view?usp=drive_link** 

**If you have 32Bit phone, go ahead and download ndk_arm32.tar.gz from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K9UPffN9WMDWJNbqxUrr3ZK-5Gc0OwCM/view?usp=sharing** 

***Inside your created folder, Create another folder named "NDK", then move your ndk_arm64.tar.gz/ndk_arm32.tar.gz into that folder.***

***In your "Mod Menu" folder, extract the contents of the Android-Mod-Menu-2.8.zip, which I put in the repository***

#

***Modding process:***

Go in the following folder "Mod Menu/Android-Mod-Menu-2.8/app" and select the build.gradle file.


Inside of it change the number from 'compileSdkVersion' from 30 to 29, and the number from targetSdkVersion from 30 to 29
